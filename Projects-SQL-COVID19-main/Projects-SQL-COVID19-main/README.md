# **COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL**

This repository contains SQL scripts and datasets for analyzing COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data.

## **How to Use:**

1. **Load the Data:**
   - **Make sure to upload the provided datasets into your SQL environment. The following files are available for analysis:**
     - **`CovidDeaths.xlsx`** – Main dataset for COVID-19 cases and deaths.
     - **`CovidDeaths_wth_Null.xlsx`** – Includes null values for missing data analysis.
     - **`CovidVaccinations.xlsx`** – Main dataset for COVID-19 vaccinations.
     - **`CovidVaccinations_wth_Null.xlsx`** – Includes null values for vaccination-related data analysis.

2. **Importing Files:**
   - **When using** **SQL Workbench**, **import the datasets that include null values** (**`CovidDeaths_wth_Null.xlsx`** **and** **`CovidVaccinations_wth_Null.xlsx`**) **to capture and analyze missing data points.**

3. **Run SQL Scripts:**
   - **Once the datasets are imported into your SQL environment, run the provided SQL scripts to generate insights, tables, or charts based on the COVID-19 data.**
   - **The scripts allow you to explore trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different countries and continents. You can modify the queries to focus on specific regions or metrics.**

4. **Customizing Queries:**
   - **Feel free to adjust the queries by altering filters and aggregation functions to analyze data for specific countries, continents, or dates. You can calculate different metrics, such as maximum death rates or vaccination percentages, based on your needs.**

5. **Handling Null Values:**
   - **Use the datasets that include null values** (**`CovidDeaths_wth_Null.xlsx`** **and** **`CovidVaccinations_wth_Null.xlsx`**) **when analyzing incomplete data. This ensures a more accurate and comprehensive analysis by accounting for missing information.**
